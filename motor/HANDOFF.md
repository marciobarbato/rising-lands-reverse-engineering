# Rust engine pilot handoff

Workstream D owns motor/ and docs/ENGINE.md on feat/codex-rust-engine in the
independent Rising-Lands-Codex-Engine clone. No other front was edited; no
merge into or push to main is performed. This is a pilot, not a frame engine or milestone.

The original-first audit was committed separately as b7dfcdd. The five routines
are Random 0x4704dc, LongRand 0x45841b/CRT rand 0x48c51d, IntToBCD 0x467cd1,
and BCDToInt 0x467d3a. Original executable identity is
6c556520c084b9300d9ac01900d1505126085c5f64b1ac5e5b615ea41c8543fb.
Existing captures and Python references are read-only, SHA pinned; no original
emulation or asset copy is required. See the [audit](research/PILOT_AUDIT.md).

The core uses semantic RNG/BCD values, a checked sparse original-address
projection with explicit load/project and opaque uninterpreted bytes, integer
virtual ticks and explicit wrapping arithmetic. The registry-based C ABI 1.0
uses copied caller buffers, typed seven-data-GPR calls, opaque u64 handles,
transactional publication and named failures. The C header and Swift CLI smoke
are in include/ and testes/. The full API/limits/versioning and reproduction
commands are in [ENGINE](../docs/ENGINE.md).

The differential requires every selected captured call: Random 24, LongRand 12,
rand 12, IntToBCD 19, BCDToInt 8, total 75 records. Nested LongRand/rand observations
are counted separately. It compares every declared byte, changed-byte triples,
seven data GPRs and 48 captured RNG transitions against original and unchanged
Python. Python BCD providers are void; their separate scratch-register adapter
is grounded in the static original review, not a Python return value. Caller
stack writes are included without filling unobserved bytes. Synthetic aliasing,
u16 round-trip, wrapping and ABI error tests do not extend native-capture claims.

Remaining work: full world/frame initialization and orchestration, actual
frame-step/input ABI, generation-stable memory/render snapshots and lifetimes,
indexed 800x600 output/palette convention, native library loading/signing and
bundling, timing calibration, later original-asset packaging, and whether a
shipped app keeps Python. The pilot default 20Hz is pacing policy only. The
current macOS live apply_frame remains reserved; the app was not changed.
Projectiles and Rust rendering are deliberately outside this pilot.

Final committed-revision validation, exact baseline/SHAs and remote status are
recorded below after the latest-main merge and required checks.
