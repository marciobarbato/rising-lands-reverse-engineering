# Economy research contract

Owner: economy. All implementations, tests, original-byte evidence, and validation reports live in `pesquisas-paralelas/economia/`. The API retains Portuguese identifiers and original French symbol names. Player-facing resource names stay PT-BR.

## Resource layout and arithmetic

`LoadGameRessource` (`0x46AB21`) and `SauveRessource` (`0x46AB33`) read/write the same 128 bytes without conversion. Base address is `0x4E2EA8`, with four players, four resource records per player, and eight bytes per record:

```text
address = 0x4E2EA8 + player * 32 + resource_id * 8
```

| Record offset | Type | Verified role |
|---|---|---|
| `+0` | u16 | RMI portion read, assigned, and debited by original routines |
| `+2` | u16 | Total returned by `GetRessource`; receives credits/debits |
| `+4` | u16 | Presentation value converted through `IntToBCD`/`BCDToInt` |
| `+6` | u8 | Digit bits used by `CalculMatiere` animation |
| `+7` | u8 | Preserved; economic meaning unconfirmed |

Mutation IDs are 0=`Peças`, 1=`Comida`, 2=`Pedra`. AI query order differs: food/stone/parts. The fourth record exists and is traversed by `CalculMatiere`, but high-level queries return zero in their fourth output instead of exposing that record's balance. Do not assign it a speculative resource name.

Preserve u16 wrapping, signed32 interpretation, original division, x87 rounding, exact debit/credit order, and partial mutations before exceptions. A resource credit is not production; a debit is not a complete purchase authorization. Costs are separate queries tied to the recovered unit/building tables.

## Modules and world boundaries

| Module | Confirmed responsibilities |
|---|---|
| `economia.py` | Resource queries, mutations, balances, unit/building costs, AI cost order |
| `construcoes.py` | Capacity, deposits, excess bags, withdrawals, indicator recalculation, warehouse initialization |
| `proprietarios.py` | Incremental ownership/neutralization effects, warehouse/library/heliport state |
| `extracao.py` | 15 mine, bag/field collection, and resource-regeneration routines |
| `recrutamento.py` | Recruitment initiation, eligibility/query/progress, explicit exit dependency |
| `producao.py` | Unit/spell production increments, colonist counts, original x87 rounding |
| `saida_tropa.py` | `SortieTroupe` economic preparation: detach an existing colonist, unload stone/food, return pending world handoff |
| `aprendizagem.py` | Library option tables/lists, costs, learning initiation, completion |
| `mercado.py` | Totals, global prices, directional sympathy/alliance, proposal evaluation |
| `transferencias_mercado.py` | `VideMatiere` transfer arithmetic and ordered side effects |
| `ordem_mercado.py` | Resource-only `MarcheOrdreEchange` handshake and consuming `MarcheEchangePrend`/`Donne` callers |

Deposit capacity and excess generation do not imply completed unit transport. `BatimentEnleveMatiere` and `BatimentCalculResource` preserve debit/recalculation order, including division-by-zero after earlier mutations. `BatimentInitCave` reconstructs per-type counts and warehouse numbers without redefining per-warehouse capacity.

Ownership effects distinguish gaining a building and neutralizing it. They update warehouse/indicator state, resource removal, library permissions/lists, heliport state, and pending balloon effects only within their verified domains. The caller owns the record's owner assignment and original sequencing. `RetiradaColonoPendente`, `DependenciaBalaoPendente`, and `SaidaRecrutamentoPendente` identify unsupported external dependencies; do not swallow them as successful completion.

Terrain resource extraction/regeneration follows original buffers, wrap behavior, and random-draw order. It does not automatically transport or credit final player resources. Recruitment initiation and progress do not implement full spawn/exit selection or allocation. The unit completion preparation below is independently supported; world conversion and final cleanup remain open.

Library initiation uses recovered costs and option tables; completion mutates lists and permissions in the observed order. Advance each supported production/learning step once at its correct caller boundary. A UI request and a simulation update are not interchangeable entry points.

Market proposal evaluation preserves signed32 arithmetic, global prices, directional sympathy, and alliance queries. `VideMatiere` has two stages using the first player's row; direct credit updates total/RMI and debits preserve partial effects if recalculation later fails. Avoid transactional rollback unless the original caller actually does it.

## Unit completion preparation: `SortieTroupe`

`SaidaTropa(recrutamento).preparar(indice, direcao)` reconstructs the prefix at `0x420E4C` through the call at `0x420F5A`, stopping **before** `CalculPosition` (`0x420698`). It returns `None` below the completion threshold or an immutable `PreparacaoSaidaTropa` describing a pending dependency. This result does not mean a unit has spawned. The original prefix removes an existing type-9 colonist and later calls `EnginSetType`; it does not allocate a new unit.

| Input/state | Width and supported domain |
|---|---|
| `indice` / original AX | Low u16; must address one of the provided 1–1,000 building records, each 276 bytes |
| `direcao` / original DL | Low u8; all 256 values are retained without interpreting geometry |
| Building `+0x7B` | Requested type u8, protected range 0–25; time comes from the type table word `+0` |
| Building `+0x8C` | Progress u32, compared unsigned against time u16 × 100 |
| Building Bag | Base `+0x0C`; first live tag-1 reference whose unit type byte `+1` equals 9 |
| Unit Bag | Base unit `+0x0A`; count/capacity words must be 0–30; referenced units must be 0–799 |
| Deposit owner | Building `+4` u8; protected range 0–3 when a deposit is reached |

The prefix does not test building activity `+0x74`, state `+5`, ownership eligibility, or recruiting-building type. Time zero with progress zero reaches preparation. Callers own those eligibility checks. The existing x87 progress increment is unchanged; this prefix uses only integer threshold and Bag/deposit operations.

Effects occur in this order:

1. Below threshold, return without changing any buffer. At or above it, use `BagRetire` mode 1 to remove the first matching colonist from the building Bag.
2. `BagRetire` decrements its word `+0x66` with u16 wrapping, shifts the remaining values/tags left, clears the old last slot, and decrements the live-count word. The colonist record is not reset or converted.
3. Obtain its Bag via `EnginGetBag` (`0x4474A6`). Repeatedly count resource ID 2 with `BagContient` mode 2 over **capacity**, then remove one matching entry over **live count**. Removal decrements `+0x66` even for resource entries. Call `BatimentAjouteMatiere(owner, resource=2, quantity=2, building)` after each removal. The quantity is the returned entry value 2, not one per slot.
4. Repeat for resource ID 1, crediting quantity 1 per removed entry. Other tags and resource ID 0 remain. Stone always precedes food, regardless of slot order.
5. Return `PreparacaoSaidaTropa(indice, direcao, unidade, tipo_unidade, endereco_dependencia=0x420698)` with the existing unit index. No world callback executes in this API.

Deposits preserve existing capacity, excess-bag, RNG, and failure semantics. Division failure can occur after the building colonist and one carried resource entry have been removed and the credit has changed a balance. `RetiradaColonoPendente` can interrupt a type-4 deposit after the cargo removal. Neither failure is rolled back or turned into a successful handoff. Do not retry this prefix after a failure or pending handoff: prior removals have already happened.

Missing colonists, out-of-buffer references, and Bag count/capacity above 30 are protected `ValueError` cases; they are not claimed original error returns. A matching resource tag beyond live count is outside the terminating supported domain and raises when removal fails, retaining earlier mutations. Invalid unit Bag state is checked after the colonist removal. The original can instead read outside the modeled pool or loop on malformed Bags.

The smallest requested core continuation is `CalculPosition(AX=building u16, BL=direction u8) -> AX=position u16`, followed by `EnginSetType(EAX=existing unit index, DX=position, CL=requested type)` at `0x420F69 -> 0x457B87`. Captured context then calls life/fatigue/experience, exit/task, and optional `EnginAsk` operations. Those calls, subsequent structure cleanup/messages, balloon paths, other production branches, and navigation remain unsupported here. The handoff snapshots the requested type at this boundary; a future original-order continuation must account for callbacks that mutate the shared building record before the original reload of `+0x7B`.

Evidence is additive in [the prefix manifest](../pesquisas-paralelas/economia/evidencias/saida-tropa.json), with exact bytes, interval hashes, original SBL names, and jump-table targets. Original EXE SHA-256: `6c556520c084b9300d9ac01900d1505126085c5f64b1ac5e5b615ea41c8543fb`; SBL SHA-256: `c3a5411255847d36161aea1aeef06ab280265c55fa5a6626cfeb7bab523cc627`. Prefix interval `[0x420E4C,0x420F5F)` SHA-256: `708fbdb1555a8562c5248924e749e537e4fdafa6f13ba98968612c9ffbf285ad`. Existing predecessor evidence/manifests are unchanged.

Fresh validation on 2026-10-28:

```sh
python3 -B pesquisas-paralelas/economia/capturar_saida_tropa.py
python3 -B pesquisas-paralelas/economia/validar_saida_tropa.py
python3 -B pesquisas-paralelas/economia/validar_saida_tropa.py --emular
python3 -B scripts/check.py --domain economy
```

The new suite has 15 tests: the local run passes 9 and skips 6 optional differential methods; the emulated run passes all 15 with no skips. Its [fresh report](../pesquisas-paralelas/economia/validacao-saida-tropa-emulada.json) records 426 original executions: 390 position dependency stops, 24 early returns, 4 `BatimentRetireColon` dependency stops, and 8 expected divide exceptions at `0x423501` after mutation. Thus 418 reach declared stops; there are no expected execution limits. Comparisons include all economy, capacity, building, unit, terrain, recruitment table/selection buffers, guards, deposit call order/arguments, mixed/duplicate Bags, u16 counter wrap, unsigned thresholds, all 26 requested types, and all 256 directions. Inputs are synthetic states, not captured live-mission states. The first sandbox x86 attempt exited with SIGILL before completing a test; approved execution with Unicorn JIT available passed. The domain local gate passes 229 tests with 101 optional differential methods skipped. Historical differential suites were not rerun by this slice.

## Validation and next work

```sh
python3 -B pesquisas-paralelas/economia/validar.py
python3 -B pesquisas-paralelas/economia/validar.py --emular
```

The saved differential report records 214 tests and 54,871 bounded executions: 54,692 declared stops, 176 expected division-by-zero exceptions, and three expected limits. No optional tests were skipped in that historical run. Expected errors and dependency stops are declared coverage boundaries, not proof that a whole economic cycle completed.

After the supported `SortieTroupe` preparation, world conversion/spawn completion, exit/balloon dependencies, general transport credit, and higher-level market callers still need further tracing. Economy should implement its own verified arithmetic/caller slices and publish callback requests to core. Do not rewrite pathfinding, physical structure placement, or graphic mappings in this domain. Read `validacao-emulada.json` and the module tests for exact current supported domains and reference buffers.

## Resource-only market exchange caller

`OrdemMercado(mercado, mundo, aceites=...)` shares the exact same `Economia` object between both providers. It copies four approval bytes from original base `0x4E2968`. `ordenar(jogador, proponente)` reconstructs all of `MarcheOrdreEchange` `[0x461BEA,0x461C4F)` for resource-only proposals, executing the real zero-unit branches of `MarcheEchangePrend` (`0x461621`) and `MarcheEchangeDonne` (`0x46189A`). Both player arguments truncate to u8 and must be 0–3 in the protected API. Invalid players are rejected before mutations, unlike the original unchecked memory accesses.

The **second argument owns the consumed proposal row**. Contacts, price indicators, alliance/sympathy, and sufficiency are not queried by this entry point. It toggles the first player's approval from zero to 1 or any nonzero byte to zero. If the second player's current approval is nonzero, or the first player's type byte is 2, it executes `Prend`, then `Donne`, then clears both approvals. It can execute even when the first player's newly toggled approval is zero. When both indices alias, the condition sees the newly toggled byte. The new Python bool return diagnoses whether both calls ran; it does not claim an original AL success flag.

| Stage | Units checked first | Resource movement | Mutation order for each nonzero resource |
|---|---|---|---|
| `receber(jogador, proponente)` / `Prend` | Offered-unit row of `proponente`, 26 × u16 | Offered-resource row of `proponente` to `jogador` | Conditional donor debit; destination total u16; consumed proposal entry = 0; destination RMI u16 |
| `entregar(jogador, proponente)` / `Donne` | Requested-unit row of `proponente`, 26 × u16 | `jogador` to requested-resource row owner `proponente` | Same order |

Resource IDs iterate 0=`Peças`, 1=`Comida`, 2=`Pedra`; quantities are u16. Zero entries are skipped completely, including player-type query and recalculation. Type-1 donors use `BatimentEnleveMatiere`; other type bytes do not debit. Destination credits wrap u16 without capacity checks or the 9,999 clamp, increasing total and RMI. Same-player transfers re-read the balance after debit. Resource row consumption distinguishes these callers from `VideMatiere`, which leaves its row intact and calls debit/recalculation even for zero quantities. The fourth resource record remains untouched.

Direct `receber`/`entregar` calls preserve approvals. In `ordenar`, only completion of both calls clears both approval bytes. A division failure during donor recalculation propagates after the donor debit and before destination credit/row consumption; already-completed entries and legs remain committed. No rollback is added. Nonzero unit rows raise `TrocaUnidadesMercadoPendente` at the first nonzero type in ascending 0–25 order: offered checkpoint `0x46166B`, requested checkpoint `0x4618DF`. The exception includes phase, both players, type, quantity, and address. It preserves the initial toggle and, for requested-unit stops, any completed offered-resource leg. These are genuine original checkpoints before the unsupported unit body, not successful unit transfers. Repeating the full order after a partial stop can retoggle approval and repeat unconsumed work; continuation requires the missing unit-transfer provider and original-order resumption.

Original EXE/SBL hashes are the same as above. [The additive market-caller evidence](../pesquisas-paralelas/economia/evidencias/ordem-mercado.json) includes exact bytes and hashes for all three caller bodies and shared epilogues. Unit branches are captured for provenance but not implemented. Fresh validation commands:

```sh
python3 -B pesquisas-paralelas/economia/capturar_ordem_mercado.py
python3 -B pesquisas-paralelas/economia/validar_ordem_mercado.py
python3 -B pesquisas-paralelas/economia/validar_ordem_mercado.py --emular
python3 -B scripts/check.py --domain economy
```

The new [original-x86 report](../pesquisas-paralelas/economia/validacao-ordem-mercado-emulada.json) records 18 passed tests, no skips/failures/errors, and 2,357 bounded executions: 2,241 routine returns (including approval waits), 104 explicit unit dependency stops, and 12 expected divide exceptions at `0x423635`. There are 2,345 declared stops and zero execution limits. The local stage suite passes 10 and skips 8 optional differential methods. Checks cover all 256 approval-byte values, aliased/all player pairs, direct calls, zero-resource skips, random protected buffers, first/second-leg unit stops and division failures, exact original total/row-clear/RMI write order, donor-debit argument order, and repeated calls. Evidence uses synthetic state and unmodified original instructions. The domain local gate passes 247 tests with 109 optional methods skipped. No prior full-x86 suite was rerun; complete market UI/AI/unit logistics or live missions are not established by these results.

## Remaining-component inventory after the first integrated slice

The first slice is integrated at main merge `1394669620a2d256b1abb9a9f0741f29728ee7eb`. These entries distinguish recovered local behavior from remaining live-world work. Symbol ranges alone identify investigation targets; they do not establish callee semantics.

| Subcomponent | Evidence and current status | Next dependency |
|---|---|---|
| Resource arithmetic, deposits, extraction, learning, progress | Existing modules and saved differential reports; new prefix adds fresh 426-execution validation | Correct real-mission dispatch and shared loaded state |
| Unit completion preparation | `SortieTroupe` prefix `[0x420E4C,0x420F5F)` implemented and integrated | Core `CalculPosition` and `EnginSetType`, then remaining caller cleanup `[0x420FB7,0x421250)` |
| Exit/balloon and unit market transfer | Prior explicit dependency classes; original `MarcheEchangePrend`/`Donne` unit loops at `0x461642`/`0x4618B6` | Original geometry/unit transfer/allocation contracts from core |
| General transport credit | SBL `EnginCalculTransporte` `0x44EA78`, `CalculTransporteEngin` `0x44F2D4`; earlier direct-call evidence includes deposits | Trace complete arrival/task gates without replacing navigation |
| Higher market exchange caller | `MarcheOrdreEchange` `[0x461BEA,0x461C4F)` resource-only path implemented and independently validated in the second slice | Serialized integration pending; nonzero unit bodies still require world providers |
| Market proposal/UI lifecycle | `CalculMarcheProposition` `[0x4670A8,0x467557)`, reset callers `[0x46634E,0x4663EB)`, persistence symbols | UI/input dispatch and world-presenter callbacks remain unimplemented |

The next selected slice is the resource-only `MarcheOrdreEchange` path. Original bytes show an approval-byte toggle, conditional ordered calls, resource rows cleared as each transfer commits, and no indicator test in this entry point. Both unit loops can execute their original zero-quantity branches without world callbacks when the corresponding unit proposal rows are zero. This closes more of the market execution chain independently of the missing core provider. Nonzero unit rows remain explicit pending stops with earlier mutations retained. The second slice is now independently validated; serialized integration remains the final stage before another slice starts.
